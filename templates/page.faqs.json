Pumping should not cause discomfort. Additionally, using the proper size flange will ensure maximum milk output. A good fit allows your nipple to move freely in the breast flange tunnel. You should see some space around the nipple. Only a little areola should be drawn into the tunnel with the nipple. The flange is too small if some or all of your nipple rubs against the sides of the breast flange tunnel. The flange is too big if more areola is drawn into the breast flange with your nipple and\/or if your areola rubs against the side of the breast flange tunnel. Refer to your instruction manual for pictures of a good flange fit. You may also call our ParentCare Department at 866-992-6332 to conduct a flange fit over the phone. <a href=\"\/collections\/accessories\" title=\"Pump Parts & Accessories\">Click here<\/a> to see our range of flanges.<\/p><h3>Other Troubleshooting<\/h3><p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/DmwQztz9LFg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/DmwQztz9LFg\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/DmwQztz9LFg<\/a><\/p>"
